1)why are default methods used in interface?

The interface that  have already implemented many methods then if we add a new method to the interface all existing implementations are broken. By adding a new method with a default implementation you remaining source-compatible with existing implementations.This provides the backwards compatibility.

2)can we use super keyword for the interface?
